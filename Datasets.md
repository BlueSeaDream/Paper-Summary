2012 20 classes. The train/val data has 11,530 images containing 27,450 ROI annotated objects and 6,929 segmentations.

### COCO Common Objects in Context

COCO 2017 Detection Challenge

http://cocodataset.org/#detections-challenge2017

The COCO train, validation, and test sets, containing more than 200,000 images and 80 object categories, are available on the download page. All object instances are annotated with a detailed segmentation mask. Annotations on the training and validation sets (with over 500,000 object instances segmented) are publicly available.

I: Object localization

The data for the classification and localization tasks will remain unchanged from ILSVRC 2012 . The validation and test data will consist of 150,000 photographs, collected from flickr and other search engines, hand labeled with the presence or absence of 1000 object categories. The 1000 object categories contain both internal nodes and leaf nodes of ImageNet, but do not overlap with each other. A random subset of 5


II: Object detection

The training and validation data for the object detection task will remain unchanged from ILSVRC 2014. The test data will be partially refreshed with new images based upon last year's competition(ILSVRC 2016). There are 200 basic-level categories for this task which are fully annotated on the test data, i.e. bounding boxes for all categories in the image have been labeled. The categories were carefully chosen considering different factors such as object scale, level of image clutterness, average number of object instance, and several others. Some of the test images will contain none of the 200 categories. Browse all annotated detection images here.0,000 of the images with labels will be released as validation data included in the development kit along with a list of the 1000 categories. The remaining images will be used for evaluation and will be released without labels at test time. The training data, the subset of ImageNet containing the 1000 categories and 1.2 million images, will be packaged for easy downloading. The validation and test data for this competition are not contained in the ImageNet training data.
